# Shoot Em Dead

A project I did to get the hang of the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine. Works with Godot 3.2.

## Just Developer Things

Are you a connoisseur of fine code? The `lib` folder contains code intended to be reused in other projects. This includes:

* GUI stuff, such as `ProgressTiles` and `Slideshow`.
* A stack-based state machine. Everyone seems to have one, so here’s mine.
